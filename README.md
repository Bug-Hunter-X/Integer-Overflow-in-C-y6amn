This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates the integer overflow bug. The program initializes an integer variable and then attempts to assign a value that is too large for the integer type. This results in an unexpected value, which can lead to unpredictable behavior in larger programs.  The solution demonstrates how to prevent integer overflow through input validation and error handling.
